1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git folder gets added which contains metadata about the repository. We need to
do it in order to track the repository for version control.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is conceptual or virtual directory which stores files which we are going
to commit. It offers the value in that it lets us bundle the files which we want to 
show up in different commits.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

I can use git diff to see the difference between the working directory and staging area
and git diff --staged to see the difference between the staging area and the last commit.

4) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

5) How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

6) What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

7) What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
